The Song Flagger allows DJs to report carts in Rivendell that are explicit,
mislabelled, or otherwise in need of review. It is called from a Macro cart
in Rivendell on the SoundPanel.

The Song Flagger is currently incomplete and will be worked on in the coming
days and weeks. To run the current implementation, use `php getSongData.php`.
